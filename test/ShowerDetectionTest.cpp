 *
 *  This test is written with an idea to have a single instance of 
 *  Tree class, so that the ROOT file is opened only once.
 *  
 *  So whatever funtions it will use, should have an additional 
 *  argument of Type Tree &.
 *
 *  Now if the detected event is Shower event then it should continue
 *  the event loop, without considering that event for efficiency 
 *  calculation.
